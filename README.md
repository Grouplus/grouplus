This app is created as part of a UBC computer science course -- CPSC 410.

The app is made using ReactNative and we open sourced it in the hope that this might help others who are new to ReactNative. Unfortunately, the app uses Parse as the backend and Parse has retired. That said, Parse is open source now and with some effort, one can still get this app working.
